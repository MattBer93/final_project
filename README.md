# Mattia Macor - Data Analytics Bootcamp final Project

The goal of this project is to try and predict the average temperatures in the next future of some locations, chosen by me.

The reason why I am interested in knowing this information is that I would like to know which cities are safe, from an environmental point of view, to move and live in for a good amount of years in the near future.

To determine if a place would be safe to live in, I would like to take into account several factors like posiibility of droughts, extreme temperatures, high sea levels, possibility of storms. However, because of lack ot time and need to simplify things, I decided to focus only on the temperature level data.

The data can be found in Kaggle, at this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data and it has been filtered by me to work only on some countries.
